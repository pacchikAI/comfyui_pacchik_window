Click on the "Window" and it will  will show you a drop down of all the windows currently open. If you don't see your window, refresh the page and you will be able to see it. 
Left, Top, Right and Bottom Ignore are to pad anything you don't want captured in the window. 

SEED and SEED CONTROL are for continous refresh.

To get ComfyUI to continously refresh changes in the window, choose this option

IMPORTANT NOTE TO REMEMBER: YOUR WINDOW NEEDS TO BE VISBLE. Windows will now allow me to automatically activate the window so ensure that your window is visible to capture.
